# Hellabyte Planning

Hellabyte is a clicker game in which the goal is to collect as many bytes of data as possible. The game begins with the user accumulating 1 byte of data every time they click the 'download bytes' button. Bytes can be used as currency to purchase upgrades which increase your production speed. This happens either via upgrading how many bytes you recieve per click (Click Upgrades), or by purchasing auto-miners which grant X amount of bytes per second without the user clicking (Auto Upgrades). After purchasing several upgrades, the user may accumulate absurd amounts of bytes up to an absolute max of 1 Hellabyte (1,000<sup>24</sup> bytes).

***Note:*** Hellabyte is heavily inspired by a game called [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). Click the link to get a better idea of what Hellabyte will look like.

MVP's
 * _Add system which increments points every time a button is pressed._
 * _Add ability to purchase click and auto upgrades which cost bytes._
 * _Add stats page with various calculations to contextualize large data sizes (ex: 1 Terabyte is equal to 500 hours of movies)._
 * _Add basic authorization and authentication so the user can save their progress._
 * _Add each user's progress to a firebase database._

Stretch Goals
 * _Allow points to be accumulated when offline by creating timestamps when logging out and loggin in._
 * _Implement 'prestige' which completely restarts the game but grants bonuses based on the amount of points gained before restarting._

Resources
 * _React/Redux_
 * _Firebase_
 * _HTML, CSS_
 * _Bootstrap_

## Important Numbers

 * _The entire internets data = 3,187,597,375,937,010,519,244 bytes (2.7 zettabytes)_
 * _Volume of a CD - 13,359.624 cubic mm_
 * _Density required for a black hole - 200,000,000,000,000,000 kg per cubic mm_
 * ***A standard sized cd with 200 brontobytes of data is dense enough to collapse upon itself and create a black hole***

## Stats


**Byte**: text file that says 'hello world' is 11 bytes

**Kilobyte**: declaration of independence in a text file is 8 KB

**Megabyte**: every work of shakespeare in plain text is about 5 MB

**Gigabyte**: a AAA game title is at least 25 GB

**Terabyte**: 1 TB is about 500 hours of movies

**Petabyte**: 2 PB is all US academic research libraries

**Exabyte**: 5 EB is a text file of all words ever spoken by humans
